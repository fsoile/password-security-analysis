**Password Security Analysis**      [see experiment-result.txt for experiment output]



**Objective:**

Conducted an independent cybersecurity experiment to evaluate how password complexity impacts resistance to automated cracking tools.



**Tools:**

* John the Ripper
* bcrypt hashing



Method:

Generated a controlled dataset of weak, moderate, and strong passwords. Converted then into secure hashes and tested their resilience against a professional password cracking utility. 



**Key Findings:**

* Common passwords were cracked almost immediately.
* Predictable patterns showed high vulnerability.
* Longer, randomized passwords demonstrated significantly stronger resistance.



**Conclusion:**

Password length and entropy play a crucial role in defending against automated attacks.
